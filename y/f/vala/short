Under some situations you need to automatize or extend the features of radare.
There are so many scripting languages out there: python, ruby, perl, lua between others.
<br /><br />
All of them are supported by the radare package and you can use them from inside r2 using
r_lang plugins and the '#!' command or externally with the r2-swig.
<br /><br />
The main issue on scripting languages is performance. The code is interpreted and all the
api bindings are wrapped, so linked list accesses and function calls are highly penalized.
